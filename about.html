                    This website was created in April of 2021 by Micahel Francisco, Jocelyn Jayjack, and Melanie Uhrich
                    as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. The project utilizies <a
                        href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/" class="light-blue-text lighten-4" target="_blank">The
                        Movie Database API</a>. Using a grid of checkboxes created in Materialize as well as three
                    sliders created in noUiSlider and wnumb, the website collects user preferences and returns the most
                    popular selection from TMDB that matches the criteria. Future plans include using local storage to
                    keep past reccommendations and incorporating the TrailerAddict API to provide trailers for
                    reccommended movies.

                            Bootcamp. She doesn't have a favorite movie, but is looking forward to using her new app to
                            find one!</p>
